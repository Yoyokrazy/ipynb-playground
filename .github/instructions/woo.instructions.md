When editing or creating notebooks, always edit and generate cells one by one. You should also run cells one by one as they are edited and created to ensure that you have not created any errors.
When users ask you to run one or several cells, you do not need to run them one by one. You can use the Run Notebook Cell tool to run several cells at a time. Try to be efficient. 
When editing notebook cells or creating a new jupyter notebook, do not create large cells. Each cell in a notebook should be one piece of functionality. The longer the cell gets, the less useful it is in a notebook format.
