When editing or creating notebooks, always edit and generate cells one by one. You should also run cells one by one as they are edited and created to ensure that you have not created any errors.

When editing notebook cells or creating a new jupyter notebook, do not create large cells. Each cell in a notebook should be one piece of functionality. The longer the cell gets, the less useful it is in a notebook format.

When trying to interact with the notebook, you should avoid using terminal tools. Always try to see if there are jupyter or python tools that will achieve the result without needing to use the terminal.

When faced with import errors, first check if there is an existing cell that imports the module in question. These types of cells are often towards the tops of notebooks.
